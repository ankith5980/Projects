# Placeholder Filter Fix - "Your Name" Issue Resolved

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Issue:** "Your name" displaying instead of "Ankith Pratheesh Menon"  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔴 **The Problem**

You were seeing "Your name" as a placeholder instead of your actual name "Ankith Pratheesh Menon" on both Home and About pages.

### Root Cause:
- ✅ Frontend had correct fallback: `'Ankith Pratheesh Menon'`
- ❌ Backend database contained placeholder: `'Your name'`
- ❌ API fetched and overwrote the good fallback with placeholder

---

## ✅ **The Fix**

Added intelligent placeholder filtering that:
1. Checks if API data contains placeholder text like "your name", "your email", etc.
2. Filters out placeholder fields
3. Only uses real data from API
4. Preserves good fallback values when placeholders detected

### Code Added:
```javascript
// Example from Home.jsx
if (apiData.fullName && !apiData.fullName.toLowerCase().includes('your name')) {
  cleanedData.fullName = apiData.fullName;
}
// If it contains "your name", skip it and use fallback
```

```powershell
cd client
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 **How It Works**

### Before:
```
API Response: { fullName: "Your name" }
   ↓
setAboutData merges it
   ↓
Display: "Your name" ❌
```

### After:
```
API Response: { fullName: "Your name" }
   ↓
Filter detects "your name" = placeholder
   ↓
Skip this field, use fallback
   ↓
Display: "Ankith Pratheesh Menon" ✅
```

## 📊 **Protected Fields**

The filter now protects these fields from placeholders:

✅ `fullName` - No "Your name"  
✅ `title` - No "Your title"  
✅ `bio` - No "Your bio"  
✅ `email` - No "Your email"  
✅ `location` - No "Your location"  
✅ `experience` - Always shows real value  
✅ `projects` - Always shows real value

## 💡 **Why This Solution**

1. **Works Immediately** - No database updates needed
2. **Resilient** - Protects against bad backend data
3. **Development Friendly** - Works even with test/placeholder data
4. **SEO Safe** - Search engines always see real name

## 🔄 **Alternative Solutions** (Optional)

If you want to update the backend database instead:

### MongoDB Update:
```javascript
db.abouts.updateOne(
  {},
  {
    $set: {
      fullName: "Ankith Pratheesh Menon",
      email: "ankithpratheesh147@gmail.com",
      location: "Kozhikode, Kerala, India",
      phone: "+91 9495540233"
    }
  }
)
```

But the frontend filter works perfectly without backend changes! ✅

# üö® URGENT: Contact Form 404 Issue - Step by Step Fix

## üîç Current Problem:
Your contact form doesn't work because the `/contact` page returns **404 NOT_FOUND**

## üìã **EXACT STEPS TO FIX IN VERCEL:**

### 1. **Login to Vercel**
- Go to: https://vercel.com/
- Login with your account

### 2. **Find Your Project**
- Click on `portfolio-ankith` project

### 3. **Go to Settings**
- Click "Settings" tab at the top

### 4. **Build & Development Settings**
- In left sidebar, click "Build & Development Settings"

### 5. **Change Root Directory**
- Find "Root Directory" section

- **Change to**: `mern-portfolio/client`
- Click "Save"

## ‚ö° **Alternative Quick Fix:**
If you can't update Vercel settings, I can modify your code to use hash routing (`#/contact` instead of `/contact`) which works without server configuration.

**Which approach do you want to try?**
1. Update Vercel settings (recommended)
2. Switch to hash routing (quick workaround)
